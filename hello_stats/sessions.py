    negotiating bidirectional communication (a "session"). Session segments
    start with 0, 1, or 2 participants, always reach 2 at some point, and then
    descend to < 2. A session segment's last event is the one that causes its
    room to drop from 2 participants to < 2. If the "event" that causes this
    is a timeout, we materialize a virtual Timeout and stick it on the end of
    the segment so we can easily count which segments timed out. Thus, each
    segment ends with < 2 participants, and the first event of the next
    segment may raise it back to 2 again. If a room never has 2 people in it
    at once, it has no segments.

    We require network activity every 5 minutes, so any room without activity
    after 23:55 doesn't need to have anything carried over to the next day.
    The rest must have their state persisted into the next day. We stick the
    portion of the last session segment that falls within the previous day,
    along with Participant state, into a dict and pull it out on the next
    day's encounter of the same room to construct a complete session segment.

    Each day's bucket consists of session segments that end (so we
    don't have to go back and change any days we've already done) on that day.
    Instead of counting how many rooms ever had a sendrecv, we count how many
    sessions ever had one. This seems the most useful daily bucketing in the
    face of rooms and sessions that may span many days.

    In order to know the beginning state of the rooms that span midnights when
    computing just one day (as is typical for the nightly cron job), we could
    either lay down the data somewhere (private, since room tokens are all you
    need to join a room) or recompute the whole previous day as well (or some
    portion of it), hoping to hit a determinable number of participants at
    some point. In the latter case, sessions that span entire days may throw
    us off. We do the former, for greatest accuracy.
